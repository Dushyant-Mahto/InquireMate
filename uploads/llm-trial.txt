Introduction 

Nanotechnology is…. 
•the control of matter on the atomic level 
•the ability to build using atoms as building blocks 
the manufacture of novel materials with novel properties. 
The trick is to manipulate atoms individually and place them exactly where needed to produce the desired structure  
The payoff for mastering this technology will be far greater than anything we have achieved so far
